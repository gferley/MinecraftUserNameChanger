# How to use:
First you need a working MCP

in the src directory are 4 files, Session.java and GuiMultiplayer.java are just a files with what to do in these
files in your MCP files, the UserNameGui.java and UserNameBtn,java just paste these in net/minecraft/client/gui

recompile and test it, if you see the button in the multiplayer screen you did all fine
